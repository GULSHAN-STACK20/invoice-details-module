## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Create a Heroku account and install the Heroku CLI
2. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

3. Set up MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
4. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

### Deploying on Replit

Replit deployment is straightforward:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Secrets
2. Click "Deploy" in the Replit interface
3. Follow the deployment wizard

## 🧪 Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints using tools like:
- Postman
- Thunder Client (VS Code extension)
- curl commands

Example curl request:
```bash
# Get all services
curl http://localhost:5000/api/services

# Create a booking
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "service": "service_id_here",
    "scheduledDate": "2024-03-20",
    "scheduledTime": "09:00-12:00"
  }'
```

## 📝 Seeding the Database (Optional)

To populate the database with sample data:

### Seed Services
```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

### Seed Invoices
```bash
cd server
node seedInvoices.js
```

This will create sample invoices with line items and payments for testing the invoice module.

Example invoice structure after seeding:
- **Invoice 1**: Partially paid invoice with $500 balance due
- **Invoice 2**: Fully paid invoice with complete payment history
- **Invoice 3**: Draft invoice with no payments

Example service creation via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/services \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "AC Repair",
    "description": "Expert AC repair and maintenance services",
    "icon": "❄️",
    "price": 500,
    "duration": "1-2 hours",
    "category": "appliance"
  }'
```
